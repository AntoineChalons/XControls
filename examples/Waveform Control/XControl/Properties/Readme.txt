Description:
This XControl provides a function generator wrapped up in an XControl that outputs an analogue waveform
data type. Supports sine, square, ramp, saw tooth and arbitary functions with djustable amplitudes, offsets, and number of periods with no further coding. User interface provides a graph that updates in response to user changes to the controls.

XControl will adjust layout as it is resized, and provides properties to set the vivisbility of the axes scales, y=0 marker and a current index position marker.
